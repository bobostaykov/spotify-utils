# spotify-shuffler

A script with some Spotify utilities I wrote for personal use, but feel free to copy.

Following values must be set as environment variables or in a `.env` file (get them from the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)):
- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID
- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET
- SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI

For the GUI to work on Mac, the script may have to be run with `pythonw` in a Conda environment.
